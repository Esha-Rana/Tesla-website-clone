# My First HTML/CSS Project ðŸŽ‰

This is my **first web project** built using **HTML and CSS**!  
I learned everything **by myself online** and created this project as a way to practice and improve my front-end skills.


## ðŸŒ± About the Project

- The website is **not an exact clone** of the original (itâ€™s meant for **learning purposes only**)  
- My main goal was to **understand structure, layout, and styling basics**
- The website looks right only on a laptop screen. Viewing it in desktop mode on a mobile phone might not display it properly.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

In future versions, I plan to:
- Add **responsive design**
- Use **CSS animations**
- Include **JavaScript** for interactivity
- Improve overall UI/UX


### ðŸ§¾ Note
This project is for **educational purposes only** â€” not for commercial use.
